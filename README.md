Course introduces the concepts of Acceptance Test Driven Development, also called Specification By Example. It teaches how ATDD changes the workflow of the entire development process. Through a series of targeted workshops, this course introduces Cucumber and Ruby scripting as well as the techniques necessary to write tests that are robust and easy to maintain. This course also includes workshops on test-data management, creating and validating XML files in the created test, and modifying scripts to handle the special needs of Ajax and JavaScript heavy applications.

The course was intended for programmers and non-programmers alike.

Previous Ruby/Watir experience was not a prerequisite.

# Course Notes
Communication tends to be the largest factor in the root cause of "bugs".
* Code tends to be over / under built
* Written requirements tend to not be expressive enough true intention
* Three Amigos == Good Start

SDLC Concepts
* Traditional
 * [Code]-[Days]-[Test]
* Agile
 * [Code][Test]
* ATDD
 * [Test][Code]
 * [Write Test][Code][Test]

Do we build a simple feature or write anticpiated frameworks?
* Simple with tons of tests => more reliable and robust

ATDD provides Regression and Confidence

Can use IRB and load and run webdriver

# Obstacles At Explorys
* No Boundries => THIS is our boundry
* No traditional QA Staff
* Beginning story acceptance criteria
